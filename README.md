# Anti-Cancer Medications: A Mouse Study Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes data from a mouse study that investigates the effects of various cancer drug treatments on tumor growth. 

## Project Goals
- Identify and remove duplicate data.
- Generate summary statistics for tumor volume data across treatment groups.
- Visualize trends in tumor growth and their relationship to mouse characteristics.
- Determine correlations and outliers in the data.

## Features
- **Bar Plots**: Compare the number of data points for each drug regimen.
- **Pie Charts**: Show the gender distribution of mice in the study.
- **Box Plots**: Highlight the distribution of tumor volumes for different treatments.
- **Scatter Plots**: Explore the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.
- **Linear Regression**: Model the relationship between weight and tumor size for Capomulin.

## Analysis
1. **Tumor Volume Trends**: 
   - Capomulin and Ramicane showed the smallest average tumor volumes.
2. **Outliers**: 
   - There is a potential outlier for the Infubinol treatment.
3. **Mouse Weight vs. Tumor Volume**:
   - A correlation between weight and tumor volume suggests that heavier mice tend to have larger tumors.
